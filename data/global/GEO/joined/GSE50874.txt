The corresponding tubulointerstitial and vascular compartment was placed into RLT solution. For easier designation we called this component tubules. Dissected tissue was homogenized using a Powergen125 (Fisher) homogenizer and stored at -80°C. Genomic DNA was prepared using DNA extraction kit (Qiagen) according to manufacturer's instructions.
