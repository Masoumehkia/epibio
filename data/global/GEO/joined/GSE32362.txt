GSM801344	untreated_NT2 cells_control1	"GSE32362,GSE33130"	untreated_NT2 cells	"gender: Male;	cell line: NT2;	cell type: embryocarcinoma"	NT2 cells were induced to differentiate with 10 µM all-trans retinoic acid (Sigma). Medium containing RA was changed every 2 days.	"Genomic DNA from RA-induced and untreated NT2 tissue culture cells was prepared using the DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (Invitrogen) according the manufacturer's specifications.  Genomic DNA (500 ng) from each sample was bisulfite converted using the EZ-96 DNA Methylation Kit (Zymo Research Corporation, Irvine, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's recommendations."
