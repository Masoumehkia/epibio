GSM1314099	IMR-90	GSE54375	IMR-90 cell line	"cell line: IMR-90;	cell type: fetal lung fibroblast;	treated with: none"	Native DNA was used	Genomic DNA was isolated from each cell line with the QIAGEN DNeasy Kit according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer. DNA concentrations and a level of quality of each preparation was determined by fluorescence with the Qubit Fluorometer (Invitrogen). Genomic DNA was treated with sodium bisulfite.
