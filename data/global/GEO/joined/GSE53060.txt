GSM1281444	Sample1_NT1	"GSE53060,GSE53096"	Nuclear Transfer Stem Cell	"cell type: Human Pluripotent Stem Cell;	cell line: Nuclear Transfer Derived"	"Fetal origin human dermal fibroblasts (HDF) were acquired from ScienCell Research Laboratories (catalog # 2300) and cultured in DMEM/F12 with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Genetically matched iPSCs were generated by transductions of the same HDF culture with  retroviral or Sendai virus vectors carrying OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, and MYC. Sendai virus-based reprogramming was carried out according to the manufacturer’s protocol (CytoTune™-iPS Reprogramming Kit, Life Technologies, Inc). Colonies with typical morphology were isolated and manually propagated similar to NT-ESC and IVF-ESC protocols."
