# why GSE35069 output doesn't have tissue name: GSE35069_Healthy..txt

# GSE29290 have same samples in GSE29290_Healthy.Breast.txt and GSE29290_Breast cancer.Breast.txt:
#   Sample_1	Sample_2	Sample_3	Sample_4	Sample_5	Sample_6	Sample_7	Sample_8

# GSE32283_Glioblastoma.Brain.txt has lots of NAs

# GSE38266 has hard columns names - should figure how to resolve them against joiner table

# GSE32146 last columns doesn't have name: 509 Unmethylated Signal, 509 Methylated Signal, Detection Pval

# GSE40360 gets: Error in read.table(filename, header = TRUE, row.names = 1, skip = 0,  : more columns than column names

# GSE40279 has different column names (4 per sample):
# "5815284007_R01C01.AVG_Beta"  "5815284007_R01C01.Intensity" "5815284007_R01C01.SignalA" "5815284007_R01C01.SignalB"

# GSE47627 has two samples: 
#  GSM1180517   B cells [CD19_Fer] (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM1180517)
#  GSM1180518 	B cells [CD19_Javi] (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM1180518)
# which have raw data on GEO site to download

# GSE56044 has samples with same names

# GSE61380 has spaces inside its header names which is the sep as well.
# this makes the header with length 298 and data with length of 100
